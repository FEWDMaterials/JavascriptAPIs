{"home":{"content":"# Javascript APIs\n---\n\nHello, [Wrold](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396#.ayfqwse40)! Welcome to Javascript APIs.\n\n## Objective\n---\nOur main today is to learn how we can leverage 3rd party APIs to enrich our webpages with dynamic data.\n\nWe will cover **public** APIs only, since those don't require anything more than some js code to configure. Most \"interesting\" APIs typically require a user authentication portion which is beyond the scope of this class.\n\n## Game Plan\n---\nHere is a rough roadmap of class for today.\n\n#### Basics of APIs and AJAX\nWe will kick things off by discussing the $.get() request and how we can recreate this with pure javascript. \n\n#### Project 1\n\nWe will build a simple Giphy Search Engine. User will input a search query which will lead to results rended as gifs.\n\n#### Wrangling Asynchronousness \nNext, we will talk about the **asynch** problem with handling AJAX requests. What happens when we try to combine a few AJAX calls at once?\n\n#### Project 2\nLet's build a weather app. It will display the weather data from three cities *in order*. For example, if my choices were:\n1. NYC\n2. Palo Alto\n3. Moscow\n\nThen, I should see weather data for NYC before Palo Alto before Moscow.\n\n#### Promises\nWhat are promises and how can we use them to make it easier for us to draw data together from multiple sources?\n\n#### Project 3\n\nLet's combine some APIs. Write an app that, using promises, looks up weather data from a specific city and then shows the user a Gif from giphy that displays the current weather conditions.\n\n#### JSONP\n\nWhat is JSONP? Why is it useful to us?\n\n#### Project 4\nBuild an app that generates a GoogleMap and based on the coordinates of the map as user pans, pulls in images from Flickr and displays it for us\n\n#### Writing API Wrappers\nLet's look at the Trello API and see how we can write a javascript driver class which will make it easier for us to make Trello calls as promises.\n\n#### Project 5\nLet's build a simple recipe saving and sharing app with trello.\n \n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Javascript APIs","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on APIs, AJAX, and promises.","idx":2},"__list__":["home","title","desc"]}
