{"home":{"content":"# Building JS Apps with API Data\n---\n\nHello, [Wrold](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396#.vk701xxec)! Welcome to Javascript APIs.\n\n### Objective\n---\nOur main today is to learn how we can leverage 3rd party APIs to enrich our webpages with dynamic data.\n\nWe will cover **public APIs** only, since those don't require anything more than some js code to configure. This means we will **not** talk about the twitter or facebook APIs which require a user authentication component to work correctly.\n\n### Game Plan\n---\n\n#### [Warm-up: Simple GET requests](#warm-up)\nThe assumption is you've probably worked with API data before. Even if you have not, with jQuery, it's literally just 4 or 5 lines of code to get started.\n\n#### [Wrangling Asynchronousness: Dealing with multiple requests](#wrangling-asynchronousness)\nHow do we force asynchronous requests to execute in order?\n\n#### [Exploring RESTful APIs: What is REST?](#exploring-restful-apis)\nWe have a good handle on GET requests, but what about all the other types? Specifically POST, PUT, DELETE?\n\n#### [Using Promises: Better handling asynchronous requests](#using-promises)\nWhat are promises and how can we use them to make it easier for us to draw data together from multiple sources?\n\n\n\n\n\n","idx":0},"title":{"content":"Building JS Apps with API Data","idx":1},"desc":{"content":"A crash course on APIs, AJAX, and promises.","idx":2},"warm-up":{"content":"# Warm-up: Simple GET requests\n---\n","idx":3},"wrangling-asynchronousness":{"content":"# Wrangling Asynchronousness: Dealing with multiple requests\n---\n","idx":4},"exploring-restful-apis":{"content":"# Exploring RESTful APIs: What is REST? \n---","idx":5},"using-promises":{"content":"# Using Promises: Better handling asynchronous requests\n---\n","idx":6},"__list__":["home","title","desc","warm-up","wrangling-asynchronousness","exploring-restful-apis","using-promises"]}
