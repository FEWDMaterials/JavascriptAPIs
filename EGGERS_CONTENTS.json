{"home":{"content":"# Building JavaScript Apps with API Data\n---\n\nHello, [Wrold](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396#.vk701xxec)! Welcome to Javascript APIs.\n\n### Objective\n---\nOur main today is to learn how we can leverage 3rd party APIs to enrich our webpages with dynamic data.\n\nWe will cover **public APIs** only, since those don't require anything more than some js code to configure. This means we will **not** talk about the twitter or facebook APIs which require a user authentication component to work correctly.\n\n### Game Plan\n---\n\n#### Warm-up: Simple GET requests\nThe assumption is you've probably worked with API data before. Even if you have not, with jQuery, it's literally just 4 or 5 lines of code to get started.\n\n#### Wrangling Asynchronousness: Dealing with multiple requests\nHow do we force asynchronous requests to execute in order?\n\n#### Exploring RESTful APIs: What is REST? \nWe have a good handle on GET requests, but what about all the other types? Specifically POST, PUT, DELETE?\n\n#### Promises: Handling asynchronous requests\nWhat are promises and how can we use them to make it easier for us to draw data together from multiple sources?\n\n\n\n\n\n","idx":0},"__list__":["home"]}
